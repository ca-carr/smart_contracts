* 0.A) Complete the table from Week 2

* 0.B) Using the website block explorer https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/, take a look the latest block in Bitcoin. Select the hex string that is the block's header. Using whatever tools you like, convert this block header to bianry and decimal. 

* 0.C) Do the same for 0.B, as for block number 1 in Bitcoin, using https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/. How do the numbers compare between 0.B and 0.C? Why is this?

## Part 1: Hash functions

Take a look at the following five text samples, A, B, C, D and E (taken from the works of A. Conan Doyle).

These texts may have been altered or manipulated, and our job is to discern the legitimate texts from the altered ones. Fortunately, to aid our task, we have the hash output (or message-digest) from one of the texts, and a partial hash output for another.

The hash output from one text is the SHA-256 digest: `a4a2f8a5 fb46f363 836a52d2 18711aa9 8b474bb9 0a6d756c 191b453e 2f63a027` \
From another text we have the partial digest: `154f7e42`, which is the last 4 bytes of the SHA-256 hash function applied to the original text.

### Task 
Using the online tool <a href="https://cryptii.com/"> cryptii</a>, identify all of the legitimate texts and all the illegitimate ones.
> Make sure to calibrate cryptii to take text input, apply the correct hash function, and produce hexadecimal output

Try to answer the questions: How can we be sure of the legitimacy? What is the purpose of the hash function in this case? 

What might we call a partial digest, and can we comment on its security? 


> Where have the identified illegitimate texts been changed?
Now that you know which text is the legitimate text, you can find the illegitamate one, by comparing the text in the lines (HINT: a famous Swedish group?)

To answer this question, we can note that A and C are very similar texts, and so are B, D and E. 
Once we identify that text C
> One of the text contains a sentence about the band ABBA, this di

## Part 2 Digital Signatures and Encryption

We are now going to take a deeper dive into digital signatures and encryption.

### 2.1:

Take a look at the shared module document, in Row 2, columns E, F, G, H, I: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LCAhbi894bGQQcT1-xw_WcshNtiXmSF47Ei797kC790/edit#gid=0

Using the software tool Kleopatra from https://gpg4win.org/download.html, or whichever tool you prefer, complete the following: 

* 1.A) Import the public key
* 1.B) Check the public key and the fingerprint, what is the process, what is the fingerprint?
* 1.C) Verify the signatures of the messages in G, and H. 
  * What does each message say?
  * Are they both valid messages?
* 1.D) Try to decrypt the message in column I. What problems do you encounter and why?


### 2.2:

Now we are going to generate our own key-pair and share it (you will need to work with someone to do this task)

* 2.A) Generate a key pair
* 2.B) Export the public key, and share it on the shared module document under column E, and share your key fingerprint under column F https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LCAhbi894bGQQcT1-xw_WcshNtiXmSF47Ei797kC790/edit#gid=0
* 2.C) Sign a message -- it can be anything you want (keep it acceptable!) -- and publish the signed message under column G, have a colleague verify your message
* 2.D) Encrypt a message to a colleauge of your choice -- it can be anything you want (keep it acceptable!) -- and answer the questions:
  * What process do you have to take to encrypt the message?
  * How is this different from the message signature aspect.

## Part 3 Smart Contracts in Bitcoin
This part of the tutorial focuses on Bitcoin smart contracts.

Bitcoin defines a stack based smart contract langauge, that is not turing complete! 

Note! You should be confident that you can give a reasonable answer the following questions:
> * What is Turing Competeness in simple terms? 
> * Why is Bitcoin's scripting language not turing complete?
> * Do we realistically expect to have turing completeness in any smart contract platform?

	
For the following problems we may wish to make use of the Bitcoin script reference guide: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script\
You should also use the following online graphical editor: https://siminchen.github.io/bitcoinIDE/build/editor.html


### 3.1:

Compute the following two prpblems below by hand, and write out the value in the stack at each step. 


Here is an example for: 4 2 op_mul
-------------------------
| Step	| Stack |	Explanation |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 0 |  | Initail empty stack | 
| 1		| 4		| Added 4 to stack |
| 2		| 4 2	| Added 2 to stack |
| 3		| 4 2 op_mul	| Added op_mul to stack and exectuted op_mul multiplying 2 by 4 in that order |
|4		|8		 | Added result of op_mul to stack |

* 1.A)  4 7 3 op_max op_min

-------------------------
| Step	| Stack |	Explanation |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 0     |       | Initail empty stack | 
| 1		  | 4		  | Added 4 to stack |
| 2		  | 4 7	  | Added 7 to stack |
| 3		  | 4 7 3 | Added 3 to stack |
| 4		  | 4 7 3 op_max	| Added op_max to stack and exectuted op_max for max of 3 and 7 retruning 7 to stack |
| 5		  | 4 7 op_min    | Added op_min to stack and exectuted op_min for min of 4 and 7 retruning 4 |

* 1.B)  4 7 op_mul 5 op_mod 

-------------------------
| Step	| Stack |	Explanation |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 0     |       | Initail empty stack | 
| 1		  | 4		  | Added 4 to stack |
| 2		  | 4 7	  | Added 7 to stack |
| 3		  | 4 7 op_mul    | Added op_mul to stack |
| 4		  | 4 7 3 op_max	| Added op_max to stack and exectuted op_max for max of 3 and 7 retruning 7 to stack |
| 5		  | 4 7 op_min    | Added op_min to stack and exectuted op_min for min of 4 and 7 retruning 4 |

### 3.2:

Consider the fucntion: (5Ã—3) MOD 4 == 3
* 2.A) In words, explain what the function does
* 2.B) Create a script using opcodes that executes the function.
* 2.C) Test your script using the online editor
	
### 3.3:

The following is a common script you might find in Bitcoin.

```
1. 304402205fc2ccf4a060cf860ad76b5933755f8ad1de54c35977fea56f3c4e0fc743990202204879136e0ad6244
1be86b9bafa831b622b63d592e859da80e3dd2cea79422560010373a3ee36354282bc8b6bd44ea4d2fcec4270f1d88
bcb8275028ae2e4dd1d2b45 
2. op_dup 
3. op_hash160
4. 66E955357C003F18D1669840924B78135784570A
5. op_equalverify
6. op_checksig
```

> 3.A) What is this kind of script usually called? 
P2PKH or Pay to Public Key Hash

> 3.B) write down what each text string represents at lines 1 and 4.
Line 1 represents the public key, line 4 represents the address.
> 3.C) Write down what each function does at lines 2, 3, 5 and 6.
Line 2 duplicates the public key on line 1. Line 3 performs the address generation algorithm on the public key value that is as the top of the stack. Line 5 checks to see if the two items on the top of the stack are equal, and only if so continues the execution of the script. Line 6 takes a signature and a public key as input and returns true only if the signature is a valid signature corresponding to that public key.
> 3.D) Is this script valid? If not, why not? 
No, the output of op_hash160 on the public key from Line 1, returns a different output to the one appearing on Line 4. This means that op_equalverify aborts the execution. 
 > 3.E) What would happen if we changed line 4 to `2CB3A540E8CF726A3D563D7A0F350724FCDB34FC`, does the script now execute correctly? If not, why not?
It would get past line 5, op_equalverify, as the op_hash160 of the public key  is equal to the address at line 10, however it does not execute as valid. This is because op_checksig needs a signature parameter as well as a public key, and no signature is provided.

## Extra

Consider the altered transaction from 3.3, what is this extra information on Line 1?
