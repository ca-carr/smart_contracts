# Module aims

This module is designed to teach you the fundamentals of smart contracts.
By the end of the module you will feel comfortable discussing smart contracts in detail.
You will have the knowledge and tools to begin development of a smart contract of your own.
You will also further develop your understanding of blockchain and decentralised systems.


The module builds from a focus on blockchain and cryptocurrency foundations, to describing smart contracts in abstraction, and deploying concrete instantiations.

The overarching objective is to provide a fundamental understanding of smart contracts and their associated technologies, as well as practical experience with design and development. The goals of this module are:

1. To instil and develop a greater comprehension of blockchain technologies;
2. to give experience with smart contract development;
3. to create awareness of the broader uses and issues of these technologies.

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)

### ILO: Module-specific skills

1. Examine approaches to smart contract construction
2. Critically compare different public blockchain systems for effective use of smart contracts 

### ILO: Discipline-specific skills

3. Analyse the workings of blockchain systems
4. Programme and deploy smart contracts

### ILO: Personal and key skills

5. Apply general programming skills
6. Blockchain programming skills and theoretical understanding

# Module structure

## Teaching and learning

There is 21 hours total of contact time, and 129 hours of independent learning. \
The contact hours are split as follows: 
- 11 hours of lectures; a 1 hour lecture each week, except for reading week
- 10 hours of tutorials; a 2 hour tutorial every other week

For the 129 independent study hours, you are expected to complete the homework **TASKS** set in lectures and tutorials, in addition to the time you should set aside for exam revision and group project work. 

## Guest lectures
This module will have some guest lectures, both in person and online. In the event that a lecture is online, information will be provided in advance. 
	
## Online provision
The module is run on a face-to-face basis, and there is **no available provision** for online learners. However, in order to make it as easy for the students as possible, lecture notes, and recordings are made available online after the lecture. Material for the tutorial is also available, however tutorials are not recorded for student privacy reasons. \
There may be occasions where the tutorials or lectures are online, instead of in-person. In this case, you will be informed in advance. 
	
## Recordings
- Lectures are recorded and made available after the lecture 
- Tutorial sessions are not recorded
	
## Lectures
Lectures consist of a mix of lecture and note taking, questions and task to complete. They are interactive. Please bring your laptops to lectures, and ensure you sit close enough to hear and join in with the session.
	
## Tutorials
After the first tutorial, all tutorials are in groups.
Tutorials are hands on and practical, including designing, coding and creating smart contracts. They take the form of interactive exploration, explanation and task completion. Please ensure you bring your laptops to the session. 
	
## Tools
We will mostly be using REMIX-IDE, and online Integrated Development Environment, designed for the smart contract language Solidity. Solidity is used in Ethereum for creating smart contracts. We will be using other tools, such as AWS, Alchemy, Hardhat to name a few. These will be explained when we come to use them. 

# Assessment
The assessment, both formative and summative assesses all ILOs as described above. 

### Formative assessment
Participation in group and individual work in tutorials and lectures. Discussion and in class verbal feedback.

### Summative assessment
- **70% exam**, with multiple choice questions and a written component
- **30% group work project**, focusing on building a smart contract, deploying it, and explaining your smart contract in the presentation


## Exam 
The exam is a 2 hour online exam and comprises:
- 20 multiple choice questions, and
- 2 long form questions 

### Multiple choice component
- The multiple choice component makes up 40% of the exam
- There will be a choice of 4 answers for each question
- There are 40 marks available in total
- A correct answer will award 2 marks
- An incorrect answer will remove 1 mark (be aware of the negative marking)
- A blank answer will award 0 marks
- Questions are randomised and taken from a larger bank of questions

### Long form questions 
- There are 2 long form questions, with written answers
- Each question accounts for 30% of the exam (30 marks maximum per question)
- A good way to prepare your answer for the long form question is to prepare it in your favourite text editing software and copy-paste in when you have your ready 

### Exam date and time
The exam date and time will be announced after the first few weeks of the module. \
Additional information will also be provided after module start, such as the how to access the exam, and over what period it is available to begin. 
> Note: the examination for this module is online 


## Group project 
The group project is the development and presentation of a smart contract.
- The group project accounts for 30% of your final grade	
- It is a 15 minute in person group presentation, including questions
- You will also record and uploaded your presentation for quality checking
- You will be assessed on the development of your smart contract, as well as the quality of your presentation and your response to questions
- You must ensure you stick to the 15 minute time limit
- A formal criteria sheet will be made available after the start of the module, which will make up your feedback sheet
