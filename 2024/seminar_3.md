# Seminar 3 (released on 20/02/2024)
This is the third seminar for the Smart Contract module.
- To complete this seminar, you may need to consult the lecture material and the related reading. 
- You are expected to be able to complete it on your own, though you may work with your group.
- Aspects of the work we will do in this seminar are related to the exam assessment, like all seminars.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Solidity challenge puzzle

Take a look at the solidity challenge puzzle, Challenge.sol, in the same directory on the Github page, and complete the following tasks:

### Task 1
Import the challenge puzzle into your oline Remix editor, then compile and run, then deploy, the script. Ensure you can deploy and interact with the puzzle. If you are stuck at this point ask a colleague for help.

### Task 2
Take a look at the remix code, and the deployment window, then answer the following questions:
- Explain what each function does?
- What does the bool, uint256 and a bytes32 keywords mean, and what are they doing?

### Task 3
Now we are going to treat the puzzle for what it is, a challenge, and solve it.
Follow the instructions to solve the puzzle. Write down the solution string, and explain the steps you have to take to solve the puzzle.

### Task 4
Create your own smart contract puzzle based on this template. The solution must be a simple word, and you can give hints as to the word. Feel free to adapt and improve on the solidity code, or add more functions. When you are done, test it, and share this contract with the Module Leader. It will be distributed to the class.


# Deploying smart contracts

## Step 1, the tools: Solidity, Remix, MetaMask, Alchemy and OpenZeppelin

First download a clean browser. We reccomend downloading the Brave browser https://brave.com/ 
then loading up Brave, you can install MetaMask.

It is important that you do not use a MetaMask that you use for real. This is only for the test.

Now you should have something that looks like:

Now we need to configure MetaMask to use the Polygon Mumbai chain. We can find out the details and add it at https://chainlist.org/ 

Now we need to sign up to the website Alchemy to get some testnet coins, which we will use later.
