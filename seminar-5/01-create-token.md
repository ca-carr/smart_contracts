# Objective
By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- Create an ERC-20 token
- Deployed it to an Ethereum-compatible network (e.g., Sepolia Testnet)
- Verified it works with MetaMask

## üß∞ Tools Needed

- MetaMask (browser extension)
- Remix IDE
- Test ETH (Sepolia Testnet)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Setting Up Remix

- Open Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org)
- On the left panel, click on the File Explorers tab
- Create a new file: SCT161.sol

## üìú Step 2: Write the Token Contract

We will be using the OpenZeppelin wizard for the next bit (https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) for the next bit, selecting Mintable, Burnable, Pausable, Callback and Permit. 

We can then paste the code we are given into SCT161.sol, it should look like the following:

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.0.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import {ERC1363} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC1363.sol";
import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import {ERC20Burnable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";
import {ERC20Pausable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Pausable.sol";
import {ERC20Permit} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol";
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract SCT161 is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Pausable, Ownable, ERC1363, ERC20Permit {
    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC20("SCT161", "SCT161")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
        ERC20Permit("SCT161")
    {}

    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() public onlyOwner {
        _unpause();
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    // The following functions are overrides required by Solidity.

    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value)
        internal
        override(ERC20, ERC20Pausable)
    {
        super._update(from, to, value);
    }
}
```

## This contract:

Uses OpenZeppelin‚Äôs libraries, including ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Pausable, Ownable, ERC1363, ERC20Permit

The contract also mints the total supply to the contract deployer and uses 18 decimals (which is standard for ERC-20)

### Question: *what does ERC1363 do?*



## Step 3: Compile the Contract
- Go to the Solidity Compiler tab in Remix
- Ensure you are using version 0.8.20 or higher
- Click Compile SCT161.sol

## Step 4: Deploy the Contract
- Go to the **Deploy & Run** Transactions tab
- Select Injected Provider - MetaMask (this will connect MetaMask, and your account)
- Ensure you‚Äôre on a testnet like Sepolia, or the mainnet Ethereum
- Under **Deploy**, enter the total supply you wish to mint, we will pick 1000
- Click **Deploy** and then confirm all in MetaMask
- You will see the contract is deployed with a contract address, we will need this

## üß™ Step 5: Test the Token
- After deployment, copy your contract address
- Also find the contract ABI and Bytecode
In MetaMask, click **Import Tokens**

Paste your contract address

You should now see your token balance

## ‚úÖ Summary
You now have a working ERC-20 token deployed on a testnet! Here's what you‚Äôve done:

Written a compliant token contract

Used OpenZeppelin for security and standards

Deployed via MetaMask and Remix

Verified token visibility in MetaMask
