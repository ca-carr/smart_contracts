📄 03-uniswap-listing.md — Listing Your Token on Uniswap
🎯 Objective
In this tutorial, you will:

Add a liquidity pool on Uniswap (e.g., MTK/ETH)

Enable public trading of your token

Learn what affects the price and how liquidity works

🌐 What You Need
Before starting, ensure you have:

An ERC-20 token deployed (from Step 1)

Tokens in your wallet (you minted them to yourself)

Some ETH in the same wallet

Access to Uniswap

You should also have completed the private sale (Step 2), or reserved some tokens for this liquidity pool.

🧮 Step 1: Choose Your Pool Size
You must add equal value of each token.
Example:

You want to pair 1 ETH and 10,000 MTK

Implied price: 1 ETH = 10,000 MTK or 1 MTK = 0.0001 ETH

This becomes your starting market price on Uniswap.

🔧 Step 2: Add Liquidity on Uniswap
Go to https://app.uniswap.org

Connect your MetaMask wallet

Click Pool → New Position

Choose token pair:

Token A: ETH

Token B: paste your MTK contract address

Set price range:

Choose “Full Range” for simplicity (covers all price movement)

Enter amounts to deposit (e.g., 1 ETH and 10,000 MTK)

Approve the token spend (MetaMask will prompt you)

Click Add Liquidity

💡 Tip: Uniswap v3 uses concentrated liquidity, so providing liquidity across the full range makes it simple but spreads your capital thin. Advanced LPs may choose a narrower range around expected price.

🔗 Step 3: Share Your Trading Link
Once the pool is live, users can:

Buy or sell MTK via the Uniswap Swap page

Just paste your token address into the interface

To share:

Format the link like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS&chain=sepolia
Example (if token address is 0xABC...):

bash
Copy
Edit
https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xABC123...&chain=sepolia
✅ Anyone can now buy or sell the token based on pool liquidity

📉 How Price and Liquidity Affect Trades
Price moves based on the constant product formula x * y = k

When people buy MTK, ETH goes into the pool and MTK comes out → price rises

When people sell MTK, MTK enters and ETH exits → price falls

If your pool is small (e.g., 1 ETH), large trades will move the price a lot

📌 Optional: Verify the Token
Visit Etherscan and paste your token address

You can verify the source code (in Remix: publish to Etherscan)

Add logo, links, and metadata if you want to look professional

✅ Summary
You now have:

A live MTK/ETH market on Uniswap

Your token is tradable and visible

The market is decentralized, no intermediaries needed
