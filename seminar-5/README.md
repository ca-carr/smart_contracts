# ðŸš€ ERC-20 Token Launch Guide

This guide walks you through the complete lifecycle of launching an ERC-20 token:

1. **Create and deploy** an ERC-20 token
2. **Launch a private sale** using a simple web interface hosted on GitHub Pages
3. **List the token on Uniswap** to enable public trading via a decentralized exchange

## ðŸŽ“ Who This Is For

This guide is written for students and early developers who have some basic familiarity with Ethereum, MetaMask, and smart contracts. You donâ€™t need prior experience with frontend frameworks or deployment tools.

## ðŸ“˜ Guide Contents

### ðŸ”¹ [01 - Create a Token](./docs/01-create-token.md)
Deploy an ERC-20 token using [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) and Remix IDE. You'll mint a fixed supply to your wallet and test it on a public testnet.

### ðŸ”¹ [02 - Create a Token Sale Page](./docs/02-sale-page.md)
Deploy a simple `TokenSale` contract that accepts ETH and sends your token in return. Then build a web interface using basic HTML/JavaScript and host it on GitHub Pages.

### ðŸ”¹ [03 - List on Uniswap](./docs/03-uniswap-listing.md)
Add your token to Uniswap by creating a liquidity pool (e.g. MTK/ETH). You'll walk through how to set the price, provide liquidity, and share a trading link.

### ðŸ”¹ [04 - (Optional) Understanding Concentrated Liquidity](./docs/04-concentrated-liquidity.md)
A deeper dive into Uniswap v3â€™s liquidity model, including full range vs concentrated strategies, liquidity math, and when to use which.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips and Best Practices

- Use **Sepolia** or **Goerli** for test deployments.
- Use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) for signing transactions.
- Use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) for compiling/deploying contracts easily.
- Use [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io) to view deployed contracts and test transactions.
- Use [Uniswap Interface](https://app.uniswap.org) to add liquidity manually.
