## Group project description

### The scenario
       
*"Your group are creating a startup, and you have decided that you want to work in the exciting world of blockchains and smart contracts. The first things you need are simple. You need backers. You need interest. You need funding. You see an opportunity for a presentation and pitch competition coming up, and you sign up for it. The event welcomes all comers, from academics, to techies and entrepreneurs.*

*The information of the event explains that the presentation will be given in person, by all members of the startup, in front of a live audience. The audience will be members of top ranking academic institutions, investors, executives and other presenters like yourselves. You are told that the you will be expected to answer questions, and that the presentation must be no more than 10 minutes long.*

*First things first, you had better come up with an idea!"*

### Description

You must create a ten minute presentation that you will present in person at the Tutorial slot in Week 11. \
Your presentation will be an idea for a smart contract that you will deploy on a blockchain platform of your choice.

You presentation must include (at least):
- A title, date, group name, names of group members and group number
- An explanation of what you have chosen to create, and why
- Advantages and drawbacks to your smart contract
- Competitor discussion
- Blockchain deployment decisions
- A working demonstration of your smart contract
- References

You may use any presentation tools you wish, such as MS PowerPoint or Beamer, but your presentation slides must be in PDF format.

### Goals and milestones
**The goal** is to create a smart contract prototype, and present it at the end of Week 11. 
    The suggested milestones are as follows:

1. Decide in your group on a smart contract idea you want to implement (end of Week 5)
2. Build a smart contract application using any tools you wish (end of Week 9)
3. Complete and deliver, in person, a presentation of your smart contract idea at Friday of Week 11 (end of Week 11)
4. Deliver a recorded presentation with the PDF of your slides to BART by the following Friday, Week 12 (end of Week 12)
   
> For bonus marks in your presentation: Ask a question of another group in their presentation, and record your question, as well as the answer and your comments in your PDF slides file.

### Presentation template
A PowePoint template is available on the <a href="https://vle.exeter.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14438"> ELE </a> page, under "Assessment information". You are free to use it, change it, adapt it, or to use something else, such as Beamer.

This page: https://www.durham.ac.uk/media/durham-university/departments-/common-awards/documents/assessment-documents/guidance-documents/Assessment-Guidelines_Oral-Presentations.pdf, from Durham University, also provides some good information for creating a presentation. 

### Uploading your presentation
