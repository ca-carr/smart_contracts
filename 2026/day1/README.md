# DAY 1
## 0. Setup Instructions

1. **Sign up for GitHub**
    - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a free account if you don't already have one.

2. **Fork this repository**
    - Navigate to the class repository: [github.com/ca-carr/smart_contracts](https://github.com/ca-carr/smart_contracts)
    - Click the **Fork** button to create your own copy of the repository under your account.

3. **Open a Codespace**
    - Go to your new forked repository on GitHub.
    - Click the green **<> Code** button and select **Codespaces**
    - Click **Create codespace on main** to open your development environment.

4. **(Optional) Use VS Code Desktop**
If you prefer working in the native VS Code application on your laptop rather than the browser, you can connect your local editor to the cloud environment.
    - Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    - Then install [GitHub Codespaces Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) once VS Code is installed.
    - Once your browser Codespace (from Step 3) is running:
    -  Click the **Menu** icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left of the browser editor.
    - Select **Open in VS Code Desktop** and allow the browser permission to launch the application.

### ⚠️ Important Note on Usage Limits
GitHub Codespaces is free for personal accounts, but it has monthly limits. To avoid using up your quota: **Always stop your Codespace when you are done working for the day.**

* **To Stop:** Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), find your active codespace, click the three dots (`...`), and select **Stop codespace**.

> **Free Tier Limits:**
> * **Storage:** 15 GB-month (Files stored)
> * **Compute:** 120 hours/month (Time spent running)
>
> *Usage beyond these limits will be billed to your personal account.*
