# Seminar 2 (released on 03/02/2025)
This is the second seminar for the Smart Contract module.
- To complete this seminar, you may need to consult the lecture material and the related reading. 
- You are expected to be able to complete it on your own, though you may work with people around you, and in some parts you may need to.
- Aspects of the work we will do in this seminar are related to the exam assessment.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Seminar 1 Bitcoin Scripts
First make sure you have completed the seminar 1 Bitcoin script part, and the final part "putting it all together".


## Solidity challenge puzzle

Take a look at the solidity challenge puzzle, Challenge.sol, in the same directory on the Github page, and complete the following tasks:

### Task 1
Import the challenge puzzle into your oline Remix editor, then compile and run, then deploy, the script. Ensure you can deploy and interact with the puzzle. 

### Task 2
Take a look at the remix code, and the deployment window, then answer the following questions:
- Explain what each function does?
- What does the bool, uint256 and a bytes32 keywords mean, and what are they doing?

### Task 3
Now we are going to treat the puzzle for what it is, a challenge, and solve it. 
Read the comments in the code, and follow the instructions to solve the puzzle. Write down the solution(s), and explain the steps you have to take to solve the puzzle.

### Task 4
Create your own smart contract puzzle based on this template. The solution must be a simple word, and you can give hints as to the word. Feel free to adapt and improve on the solidity code, or add more functions. When you are done, test it, and share this contract with the Module Leader. It will be distributed to the class.


## Github and MetaMask

### Github accounts

Create a github account and connect with your group members, create a project and share a sample document.

### MetaMask

In a new browser (possibly Brave or Mozilla), download and install MetaMask, then answer the questions
- What is your address?
- Where is the public-key and how is it associated with the address? 
- What is the private-key associated with the address?
- Why should you not share this private key?
