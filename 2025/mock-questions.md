Your answer must at least cover the following points:

- How the transaction creator can identify what smart contract they intend to interact with
- The relationship between a private key and the digital signature on a transaction
- How the digital signature is created
- How anyone can verify the digital signature on the transaction

-	prevent certificate forgeries
-	provide proof to a potential employer
-	hide identifying information
-	prevent the selling of certificates
-	allow universities to revoke or alter certificates
